## Inteligencia Artificial Generativa en forma local. LLMs en tu PC usando ollama y ollamar

#### Using local LLMs in R with Ollama and ollamar: installation, use, and offline text analysis

### About the course

**Date** December 1, 2025, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (UTC-3)

**Mode**: Online

**Language:** Spanish

**Registration**: [Inteligencia Artificial Generativa en forma local](https://www.eventbrite.cl/e/llms-en-tu-pc-inteligencia-artificial-generativa-en-forma-local-tickets-1953038152689?aff=oddtdtcreator)

This introductory workshop provides a practical experience with local Large Language Models (LLMs) using two basic tools: 1) ollama, a lightweight platform that allows downloading and running language models directly on a personal computer, without the need for an Internet connection or access to external APIs; 2) ollamar, a library to integrate R with Ollama which facilitates working with data structures (for example: conversation/chat histories) that are standard for different LLMs.

Throughout the session, participants will be guided through the installation of Ollama, loading a compatible model (such as LLaMA, Mistral or others), and executing structured prompts to perform basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Work will be done with a Spanish-language news dataset, applying local models to identify the tone of a news item, generate summaries, etc.

The objective is to provide a first technical approach to the use of LLMs without an internet connection, exploring both their potential and their limitations compared to cloud models.

### Requirements

To participate you need a computer and internet connection. To avoid compatibility and hardware problems, the workshop will be developed in a Google Colab (with R kernel).

### Instructor

**German Rosatti** - Germán Rosati is a sociologist, Associate Researcher at CONICET and professor at the Interdisciplinary School of Advanced Social Studies at UNSAM, where he coordinates factor~data, a laboratory in Computational Social Sciences. He has participated in projects that use LLMs for information extraction in administrative and journalistic texts, automated classification and bias analysis.

In this tutorial, each participant will learn to design a presentation or talk with a clear structure and a message that generates impact, using audiovisual resources strategically.

The objective is to provide practical tools to overcome the "blank page" block and develop a powerful narrative through storytelling technique that allows achieving specific goals: inspire, get support for a project, or simply communicate an idea with confidence.

Through practical exercises, attendees will be able to take away an idea of the structure of a talk or presentation and the importance of practice as a fundamental step to be prepared.

Although the idea of "storytelling" may seem foreign to data science, it actually forms an essential part of it: it's about discovering and communicating the stories that the data itself reveals. It is precisely at that point where we focus this tutorial: finding the stories behind the work that each participant performs and discovering the best story to connect with the audience.

### Requirements

No specific technical knowledge is required. This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to improve their communication and presentation skills.
