### Presentation Formats

#### Oral Communications

Presentations on research results, progress reports, or specific developments that, due to their originality or potential application and impact on the use or development of R in academia or industry, are of interest to the regional R community. Participants in this format will have 20 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for dialogue with the audience. <br>

#### Lightning Talks

Lightning talks provide an opportunity to present and discuss advancements, ideas, ongoing research, experiences, and challenges related to the themes of LatinR. Participants in this format will have 5 minutes for their presentation. Lightning talks will be grouped into thematic sessions that will include time at the end for a round of questions.<br> 

#### Workshops

Details for those who wish to propose online workshops for this edition of LatinR will be shared soon.


### Proposal Submission Guidelines

-   All works must be submitted in PDF format, **without authors or affiliation**, in letter size, written in font size 11 with single spacing. The length must not exceed two pages.

- There is a package developed by Elio Campitelli that allows the abstract to be prepared in an RMarkdown file. You can check the details in [this post](https://latinr.org/en/blog/en/2020-03-03-latinr-package.html). In previous editions of the conference, it was possible to submit directly from R. This time it is not possible as the platform is different. If you prefer to use a word processor, we ask that you use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrPbi2AR5Rcq5fKMkC_yK_9gpez4Fmtz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107644076848762167027&rtpof=true&sd=true) for submission.

- Works must be submitted through the [Open
    Review](https://openreview.net/group?id=LATIN-R.com/2024/Conference) platform. Registration is required to make the submission. It is important to consider that registration is not automatic; it can take up to 24 hours for the account to be activated if using an institutional account and longer if using a personal account. **It is suggested not to leave account creation to the last minute.**

- In the case of works with shared authorship, it is sufficient for one person in the group to be registered on Open Review.

- Only one work can be submitted as the main author. However, it is possible to participate as a co-author in two other works.

- All works will be carefully reviewed by the members of the Scientific Committee (to be announced soon), considering their originality, contribution, technical quality, and clarity.
