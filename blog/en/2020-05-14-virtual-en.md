#### Dear community:

As expected, the seriousness of the health situation in our region and the uncertainty it generates make it inevitable to cancel the on-site event in Montevideo. The in-person event in that city will be reschedule for 2021, on a date to be announced before the end of the year.

One of our goals in organizing LatinR has always been bringing together the Latin American R community, learning from the developments and research of its members, and generating bonds of collaboration and friendship. We do not want to lose that this year. In moments like these, having the opportunity to share with the community becomes even more valuable. That is why we have decided to organize an online activity on the dates when the conference was originally planned (October 7-9). We are still ironing out the characteristics of the event, so we hope to announce during the next weeks both the details of this activity, and the modes of participation.

In the meantime, take care.

See you (virtually) in October!

LatinR 2020 organizing team
